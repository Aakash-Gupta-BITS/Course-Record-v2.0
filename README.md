# Course-Record-v2.0
This was one of my large projects which I did on C# and UWP platform.

## About the project
In my first and second year, I was learning C# and was in search for a project. One thing that I thought is that there are applications of Student Union or other campus departments on making a time table, but those were available only for web applications. Also, I was working on a project on Course Details which was intented as a bookeeper. I somehow made it but it was not flexible.

So I decided to make my app more flexible with new beautiful UWP additions, such as NavigationMenu. This project is a complete makeover of my previous one and it contains the time table visualizer support too, so that classes and their timings can be seen.

## Features
0. Google Authenticator - for BITS accounts only.
1. Contact info of students and teachers.
2. Courses:
   - CRUD operations.
   - Books section.
   - 'CT log' contact section.
   - Events section, such as upcoming tuts, exams, quizzes.
   - Handout section.
   - Course overview section.
   - Teachers section.
   - Test marks section.
3. Time table visualizer.

## Discontinuation
The project was completed and I was very happy that everything was working as I was expecting it to do. But there were few problems:
1. I was not a UI designer, so the traditional pen/paper approach seemed more fast than using this app altogether.
2. I didn't know how to enable support for internet API calls at that time, so the app always worked in isolation and no benefit of mutual conversations was there. I once thought that adding conversations to app will prove to be very successful on people using my app, but I didn't have knowledge at that time.

## Note for future contributors, if any
If you think you can learn from this project/add more features, you are more than welcome and I will be happy to guide you through the project structure. Kindly note that this project was written during my initial learning days of programming, so many best practices are not used here and thus, code can be imporoved significantly.
